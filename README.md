# Sign Language Recognition

Recognises the American Sign Language gesturesfocuses on disabled people for communication using OpenCV, Tensorflow , Scikit-learn ,etc.  
We first take an image and convert it to greyscale and apply the canny edge detection of the OpenCV to get the edges and this image are sent for training .<br>
After training we are have written a python script named video1.py where we are predicting the signs in real time.
